Q1. Find flag.txt.
[HINT]: Just download the python file pickleme.py. run the file ''' python3 pickeme.py'''. You will get a token, copy the token content between quotes ' ' and paste the token into the encoded payload area under cookies section.
Don't forget to start the reverse shell and change the ip address in the script to your ip address. Once the session has started then run the command ''' find / -name "*flag.txt*" 2>/dev/null. You will get the flag.txt
